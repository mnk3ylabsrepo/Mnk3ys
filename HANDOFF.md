# Handoff: new repo for founder

This folder is the full MNK3YLABS site. To make it a new repo:

1. Create a new empty repo on GitHub.
2. In this folder: git init, git add ., git commit -m "Initial: MNK3YLABS site", git remote add origin <repo-url>, git push -u origin main.
3. Give the founder access. They copy .env.example to .env and add their secrets. No .env is included here.
